# CSC120-FinalProject

## Deliverables:
 - Your final codebase
 - Your revised annotated architecture diagram
 - Design justification (including a brief discussion of at least one alternative you considered)
 - A map of your game's layout (if applicable)
 - `cheatsheet.md`
 - Completed `rubric.md`
  
## Additional Reflection Questions
 - What was your **overall approach** to tackling this project?

    My overall approach to tackling this project was to seperate the different parts of the game into different classes (Person/user, ghosts, items, rooms) so that I would be able to implement different results of the game. 

 - What **new thing(s)** did you learn / figure out in completing this project?

    I learned how to use better work between different classes, I feel more confident on when to use static methods and variables and why, and how to leave methods without finishing the rest of the code in the method using return. I also learned how to better use String[] to read inputs and interpret them.

 - Is there anything that you wish you had **implemented differently**?

    I would have liked to have more time to make my readInputs() method more clear. 

 - If you had **unlimited time**, what additional features would you implement?

    I would have liked to eventually change my layout so that maps could be used to move between rooms. I also would have liked to add more rooms and more ghosts. 

 - What was the most helpful **piece of feedback** you received while working on your project? Who gave it to you?

    The most helpful feedback was in class when the professor said that it could be helpful to create a smaller functional game and then expand it to have more options and results.

 - If you could go back in time and give your past self some **advice** about this project, what hints would you give?

    I would advise myself to plan out my architecture diagram more fully before coding.  


 - _If you worked with a team:_ please comment on how your **team dynamics** influenced your experience working on this project.
